My name is Carolina da Esc√≥ssia Walraven and my objective as web designer is to make websites that are comfortable for the eyes and easy to navigate. 
I want to focus on User Experience, learn more coding and hopefully some day work for a big company like Google. 
I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm willing to fight in order to achieve my goal. Nawriz kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
